\section{Reducing Benign Schedules} \label{sec:schedule-reduction}

This section presents \xxx's benign schedule reduction component, 
including automatically annotating adhoc synchronizations 
(\S\ref{sec:adhoc-sync}) and pruning benign schedules 
(\S\ref{sec:verify-race}). This component in total greatly reduced 
\reducerate of the total reports (see \S\ref{sec:reduce}).

\subsection{Annotating Adhoc Synchronization} 
\label{sec:adhoc-sync}
% Busy loop filter.
Developers use semaphore-like adhoc synchronizations, where one thread is
busy waiting on a shared variable until another thread sets this variable to be
``true". This type of adhoc synchronizations couldn't be recognized by \tsan or 
\ski and caused many false positives.

\xxx uses static analysis to detect these synchronizations in two steps. First, 
by taking the race reports from detectors, it sees if the ``read" instruction 
is in a loop. Then, it conducts a intra-procedural forward data and control 
dependency analysis to find the propagation of the corrupted variable. If \xxx 
encounters a branch instruction in the propagation chain, it checks if this 
branch instruction can break out of the loop. Last, it checks if the ``write'' 
instruction of the instruction assigns a constant to the variable. If so, \xxx 
tags this report as an ``adhoc sync".

Compared to the prior static adhoc sync identification 
method SyncFinder~\cite{syncfinder:osdi10}, which finds the 
matching ``read'' and ``write'' instruction by statically searching program 
code, our approach leverages the actual runtime information from the race 
reports, so ours are much simpler and more precise.
% Evaluation confirmed that this filter can filter out 
% busy looping synchronization with a precision of 100\% by our manual inspection.

\subsection{Verifying Real Data Races}\label{sec:verify-race}

% Compensate the lack of pointer aliasing.
\xxx's dynamic race verifier checks whether the reduced race reports 
are indeed real races. It also generates security hints for the 
following analysis. The verifier is lightweight because it is built on top of 
the \lldb debugger. We find that a good way to trigger a data race is to catch 
it ``in the racing moment". The verifier sets thread specific breakpoints 
indicated by \tsan race reports. ``Thread specific" means when the breakpoint 
is triggered, we only halt that specific thread instead of the whole program. 
The rest of the threads are still able to run. In this way, we can actually 
catch the race when both of the racing instructions are reached by different 
threads and are accessing the same address.

% Currently, we are not aiming for completeness(ie. miss no bugs),
% rather our dynamic filter aims to provide sound results filtered from race 
% detector's reports by eliminating false positives.


%A script will extract filenames, line numbers from the reports and set thread
%specific breakpoints at the corresponding locations. 
%Once a breakpoint is hit within \lldb, our script will extract the address of
%the shared memory that the instruction is accessing. We’ll then create a tuple
%that contains \verb!(AccessedAddress, !\verb!InstructionType,! \verb!ThreadID)!.
%\verb!InstructionType! indicates where it’s the Read Instruction or the Write
%Instruction in the racing pair. It will store this tuple in a global array and
%suspend the thread.  Besides storing the info and suspend the thread, our tool
%will also compare this info to previous stored info of the other instruction in
%the racing pair from the other suspended threads in the global array.
%If there is a match, a match means the \verb!AccessAddress! are the same while 
%\verb!ThreadID!
%and \verb!InstructionType! are different, we know that both instructions can be 
%reached
%simultaneously by different threads and they’re accessing the same address.
For each run, \xxx's dynamic filter verifies one race. Once a data race is 
verified, the verifier goes one step further. It prints the following dynamic
information as security hints including, the racing instructions from source
code, the value they're about to read and write and the type of the variable
that these instructions are about to read or write. These hints show whether a 
NULL pointer difference can be triggered or an uninitialized data can be read 
because of the race.

It is possible that due to the suspension of threads, the program goes into a 
livelock state before verifying any data races. We resolve this livelock state
by temporarily releasing one of the currently triggered breakpoints. 

%In other to resolve livelock, we define two livelock states.\\
%{\bf State 1:}
%There isn’t any incoming breakpoints hit within certain time threshold.\\
%{\bf State 2:}
%All the executing threads are paused by our system.

%In the first case, if there is any suspended thread, we’ll pick one randomly
%and release that thread. Note that by saying release the thread, we don’t mean
%remove any breakpoints. So this released thread can still hit breakpoints in the
%future execution. The stored info in the global array will also be removed.
%If there isn’t any suspended threads, we will just terminate the whole program
%and move on to next data race that needs to be verified.
%In the second case, we will also randomly pick up one thread and release it.
%The records stored in the global array will also be removed at the same time.

%Overall, this livelock resolving mechanism prevents our verifier from becoming
%livelocked and maximize the chances in verifying data races for each run.
%When the system is halted, we only release one thread. In some circumstances,
%this action sequentialize the execution of the targeted program. We make this
%design choice because we choose to be conservative in order to maximize the 
%chance
%of verifying the racing pairs in the sacrifice of performance.

Previous works~\cite{racefuzzer, conbreak, conpredicates} adopt the same core
idea of “thread specific breakpoints” and
data race verification. \xxx's dynamic race verifier provides a lightweight,
general, easy to use way (integrated with existing debugger)
in verifying “potentially” harmful data races and their consequences.
Compared with RaceFuzzer~\cite{racefuzzer}, \xxx's verifier achieves the goal 
without requiring heavyweight Java instrumentation. Compared with
ConcurrentBreakpoint~\cite{conbreak} and ConcurrentPredicate~\cite{conpredicates},
we require no code annotations and importing libraries.

Overall, \xxx's dynamic filter makes developers be less dependent on 
the particular front end race detector, because no matter how many false 
positive the front end race detector generates, this verifier will make sure 
the end result is accurate.
% Our tool is sound.

% To achieve soundness, \xxx's verifier trades off completeness.
There are two cases that could cause \xxx's race verifier to miss real races. First, if the 
race detector doesn't detect the race upfront, the verifier won't report the 
race either. Second, depending on runtime effects (\eg, schedules), some races 
can't be reliably reproduced with 100\% success rate~\cite{conpredicates}.

\section{Computing Vulnerable Input Hints} \label{sec:input-reduction}

This section presents the algorithm of \xxx's static vulnerability 
analysis (\S\ref{sec:algo}) and dynamic verifier 
(\S\ref{sec:vulnerability_verifier}). Since the input of the static 
analysis is the reports from concurrency bug detectors, this section then 
describes how \xxx integrates this analysis with two existing race 
detectors (\S\ref{sec:integration}).

\caption{Vulnerable input hint analysis}
\label{alg:analyzer}
\end{algorithm}



Algorithm~\ref{alg:analyzer} show \xxx's vulnerability analyzer's
algorithm. It takes a program's LLVM bitcode in SSA form, an LLVM \v{load} 
instruction that reads from the corrupted memory of a bug report, and the call 
stack of this instruction. The algorithm then does inter-procedural static 
analysis to see whether corrupted memory may propagate to any vulnerable 
site (\S\ref{sec:patterns}) through data or control flows. If so, the algorithm 
outputs the propagation chain in LLVM IR format as the vulnerable input hint 
for developers.

The algorithm works as follows. It first adds the corrupted read
instruction into a global corrupted instruction set, it then traverses all
following instructions in the current function and if any instruction is affected
by this corrupted set (``affected" means any operand of current instruction
is in this set), it adds the instruction into this corrupted set.
The algorithm looks into all successors of branch instructions as well as
callees to propagate this set. It reports a potential concurrency attack when a
vulnerable site (\S\ref{sec:patterns}) is affected by this set.

To achieve reasonable accuracy and scalability, we made three design decisions. 
First, based on our finding that bugs and attacks often share similar call 
stack prefixes, the algorithm traverses the bug's call stack 
(\S\ref{sec:challenge}). If the algorithm does not find a vulnerability on 
current call stack and its callees, it pops the latest caller in current call 
stack and checks the propagation through the return value of this call, until 
the call stack becomes empty and the traversal of current function finishes. 
This targeted traversal makes the algorithm scale to large programs with 
greatly reduced false reports (Table~\ref{tab:racefilter}).
% The algorithm did 
% not miss the evaluated attacks either (\S\ref{sec:known-attacks}).
 
Second, the algorithm tracks propagation through LLVM virtual 
registers~\cite{llvm}. Similar to relevant
systems~\cite{conseq:asplos11,gist:sosp15}, our 
design did not incorporate pointer analysis~\cite{bddbddb, dsa:pldi07} 
because one main issue of such analysis is that it typically reports
too many false positives on shared memory access in large programs
(\S\ref{sec:limits}).

Our analyzer compensates the lack of pointer analysis by:
(1) tracking read instructions in the detectors at runtime 
(\S\ref{sec:integration}), and (2) leveraging the call stacks to precisely 
resolve the actually invoked function pointers (another main issue in pointer 
analysis).

Third, some detectors do not have read instructions in the reports (\eg, 
write-write races), and we modified the detectors to add the first \v{load} 
instruction for these reports during the detection runs 
(\S\ref{sec:integration}).

% Heming: TBD. This paragraph needs to go deeper to introduce the algorith 
% rather than repeating the ideas of the algorithm (done in overview).
% Our analyzer is designed to favor accuracy (\ie, reducing detector reports' 
% false positives and false negatives) and scalability (\ie, being able to 
% analyze large programs). To meet this design goal, our analyzer incorporates 
% two pieces of runtime information, load instructions and their call stacks into 
% our static analysis. Because the load instruction is indeed the starting point 
% of reading corrupted memory (at least the structural pattern is corrupted), we 
% make our static analysis focus on only the relevant propagation flows of the 
% actual read instruction and we do not need to analyze the irrelevant ones, 
% greatly improving accuracy and scalability. Because our analyzer also takes 
% call stacks into account, we are able to precisely conduct the inter-procedural 
% analysis (\eg, mitigating the ambiuity of function pointers). 

All five types of vulnerability sites we found (\S\ref{sec:patterns}) have
been incorporated in this algorithm. The generated vulnerability reaching branches
from this algorithm serve as vulnerable input hints and helped us identify
subtle inputs to detect \nknownVul known attacks and \nunknownVul previously
unknown ones (\S\ref{sec:unknown-attacks}).

% Compared to existing consequence analysis, our analyzer is inter-procedure,
% because our study XXX. Break Conseq. Two examples. First, libsafe,
% vulnerability is parsed through return value of function call. Second, TBD.

\subsection{Dynamic Vulnerability Verifier} \label{sec:vulnerability_verifier}
\xxx's dynamic vulnerability verifier is built on \lldb so it is lightweight. 
It takes the input from its static vulnerability analysis, including the 
vulnerability site and the associated branches. It re-runs the program  again 
and prints out whether one could reach the vulnerability site and trigger the 
attack. If the site cannot be reached, it prints out the diverged branches as 
further input hints.

\subsection{Integration with Concurrency Bug Detectors}
\label{sec:integration}

\xxx has integrated two popular race detectors: \ski for
Linux kernels and \tsan for application programs. To integrate \xxx's
algorithm (\S\ref{sec:algo}) with concurrency bug detectors, two 
elements are necessary from the detectors: the \v{load} instruction that reads 
the bug's corrupted memory and the instruction's call stack.

% How to work with diverse detection tools. How to parse the bug reports
% from detection tools. How to parse call stacks and 
% line numbers.

% For SKI race detection hacking:
\ski's default detection policy is inadequate to our tool because it only reports the
pair of instructions at the moment when race happens. This policy incurs two
issues for our integration. First, the pair of instructions could both be write
instructions, which does not match the algorithm's input format. Second, it is
essential to provide to the algorithm an as detailed call stack, which reads 
from the corrupted racy variable, as possible.

%TBD: where is the watching technique of \ski?
We modified \ski's race detection policy as follows. After a race happens, the
physical memory address of the variable will be added to a \ski watch list,
marking such variable as corrupted. All the call stacks of the following read to
the watched variable will be printed. If a write to a watched variable occurs,
such write sanitizes the corrupt value and removes the variable from the watch
list. In this way, we can catch all the call stacks of potential problematic 
use of racy variables. The final race report will show all the stacks of the 
reading thread.
% Note that we use physical address instead of 
% virtual address to avoid the
% problem where the variable is shared between different processes and mapped to
% different virtual addresses.
% 

% Compile kernel stack for analyzer.
Another issue for \xxx to work with kernels is that \ski lacks call stack 
information. We configure Linux kernel with the CONFIG\_FRAME\_POINTER option 
enabled. Given a dump of the kernel stack and the values of the program counter 
and frame pointer, we were able to iterate the stack frames and constructed call 
stacks.

% % call stack construction. % To make 
% the construction even faster, we modified % \ski to maintain a shadow % kernel 
% stack which is updated on each memory write % to the stack and invalidated % on 
% qemu~\cite{qemu} CPU switch or syscall return % in the guest. Finally, the % 
% addresses in the call stack of a given race report % is converted to % 
% ``filename:lineno", a proper input format for the algorithm.

% Modify front ends to contain read instructions. Make a forward pointer to impl
% section.

% TBD: all above are about \ski, any hacking in \tsan for integration with the
% analyzer?

% \subsection{Design Decisions of the Analyzer} \label{sec:tool-design}
% 
% No alias, but use software watch points to get all the read to corrupted 
% variables.
% 
% Modified the concurrency error detectors to reflect the reads.
