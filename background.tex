\subsection{Concurrency Attack v.s. Concurrency Bug}
Extant studies \cite{con:hotpar12, acidrain:sigmod17}  concurrency 
attacks into  
concurrency bugs and made three major findings on concurrency
attacks. First, concurrency attacks make much more severe threats:
35 of the bugs can corrupt critical memory and cause four
types of severe security consequences, including privilege escalations [7, 10],
malicious code injections [8], and bypassing security authentications
[4, 3, 5].
Second, concurrency bugs and attacks can often be easily
triggered via subtle program inputs. For instance, attackers
can use inputs to control the physical timings of disk
IO and program loops and trigger concurrency bugs with a
small number of re-executions. Third, compared to traditional
TOCTOU attacks, which stem from corrupted file accesses,
handling concurrency attacks is much more difficult because
they stem from corrupted, miscellaneous memory accesses.
