\subsection{Concurrency Bug}

Concurrency bugs in multi-threaded program is common and caused great loss in real world. 
Non-deadlock concurrency bugs 
%includes data races\cite{datacollider:osdi10, savage:eraser, yu:racetrack:sosp}, 
atomicity violations\cite{}, order violations\cite{} and others by extant studies\cite{lu:concurrency-bugs,conmem:asplos10}. 
A extant work exclude data race as concurrency bug pattern 
because data race does not certainly cause a concurrency bug\cite{lu:concurrency-bugs} and many data races are benign races. 
However, our observation shows that data race is necessary for the attacks we studied, 
although the bugs can be categorized to atomicity violation or order violation. 
And also, current race detectors can well readily detect the bug happening that causes attacks.

??? Here why data race detector? How about atomic violation detector? Order violation detector?
 
\subsection{Concurrency Attack}
Extant studies \cite{con:hotpar12, acidrain:sigmod17} show rise of concurrency 
attacks. We conclude two main features for concurrency attacks comparing to concurrency bugs. 
First, concurrency attacks make much more severe threats:
concurrency attacks can corrupt critical memory and cause four
types of severe security consequences, including privilege escalations\cite{uselib-bug-12791, mysql-bug-24988},
malicious code injections \cite{msiexploit},  bypassing security authentications\cite{cve-2010-0923, cve-2008-0034, cve-2010-1754}
, and breaking database integrity\cite{acidrain:sigmod17}. 
Current concurrency bugs 


Second, concurrency bugs and attacks can often be easily
triggered via subtle program inputs. For instance, attackers
can use inputs to control the physical timings of disk
IO and program loops and trigger concurrency bugs with a
small number of re-executions. 

More ever, attack - instruction
