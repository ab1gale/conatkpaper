\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}


%Conccurrent program is hard to be correct. Concurrency bugs are common in modern multi-thread programs. 
%Some concurrent bugs cause order violation, wrong output, program crash. 



%Even worse, a prior study shows that concurrent bugs leads to concurrent attacks:...



%Extant work well detects concurrent bugs (well studys on interleaving). Most of them focus on detecting 
%bug happenings. Some work (\conmem) propose to focus on severe bugs that may cause program crashes. 


%However,Our observations over \observenum concurrency attacks shows that ... 


% First of firsts?  Most concurrent attacks is due to data race

%First, security consequences may happen after raced variables propagating through program executions. 

%Second, bugs that cause crash may lead to worse effects..


%Although extant work is great, they cannot solve the following issues.


%First, concurrent attacks are hidden in large number of bug reports. 


%Second, exploiting the concurrent attacks needs more information.


%To addressing the issues, we introduce a model covering all studied attacks.


%Leveraging the model, we build a framework.


%Two parts, \firstpart - Reducer (combining dynamic detection and static analysis)


%\secondpart ... Fuzzer?


% Evaluation shows that we reduce 90% false positive reports. 
% Detected 7 known attacks, 2 previous bug to attack, 4 unkown attacks.
