\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}


%1. Interleaving - crash - explicit behaviour - 
Concurrency program is hard to be correct. 
Concurrency bugs are common in modern multi-threaded programs\cite{lu:concurrency-bugs,conmem:asplos10,conseq:asplos11, lu:muvi:sosp} 
including atomic violation, ..., and especially data race.
Extant work well explore interleaving that cause concurrency bugs, 
and efficiently detect explicit concurrency bugs that direct to  
severe consequences such as execution order violation, wrong output and program crash.
%and by employing memory sanitizers and thread sanitizers, severe concurrency bugs
%may be explicit(?..).

%2. Recent study - con attacks - structural , consequence, [in-explicit severer]
Recent studies\cite{acidrain:sigmod17,con:hotpar12} show rise of concern about \emph{concurrency attacks}.
By triggering concurrency bugs and employing subtle inputs, 
hackers may leverage the corrupted memory to construct 
attacks, including privilege escalations\cite{}, hijacking code execution\cite{}, bypassing security checks\cite{}, 
and breaking database integrity\cite{acidrain:sigmod17}.
However, these vulnerabilities often hide in large amount of concurrency bug reports. 
For example, bug information leveraged by a xxx attack is hidden in 1000 race reports 
produced by TSAN\cite{tsan}, a famous and widely used data race detector. 
Also, to construct concurrency attacks, despite the inputs of leveraged concurrency bugs, 
attacker may need other crafted inputs to exploit the vulnerabilities. 
In CVE-2017-7533 exploited by our team, 
despite leveraging a data race bug to construct kernel heap overflow, 
we also require another thread to be the victim target, 
and finally achieve arbitrary code execution and get a root shell.   


%3. Unfortunately, most extant work -- detect bug, corruption 
%   Our study - old bug - attack
%   However in danger
%   Sigmod 
Unfortunately, although great progress has been made to detect and replay severe bugs (program crash\cite{conmem:asplos10}), 
extant work still lacks exploration of concurrency attacks from enormous concurrency bugs. Our study over several known concurrency 
bugs\cite{apache-bug-25520, apache-bug-46215} shows that even concurrency bugs have been successfully detected and reported, 
professionals still lack knowledge about how severe consequences these bugs may cause. 
For instance, \emph{apache-25520}\cite{apache-bug-25520} has been 
reported over years and well studied by researchers\cite{lu:concurrency-bugs}.  
We still firstly exploited a new heap overflow attack leveraging on this bug and break the HTML integrity.  

%4. Two major challenges : 
%a. concurrent bug detectors (justify) 
%b. other input for attack


%5. New model for general attacks [] -- *vulnerability window 


%6. Leveraging this model, framework - address two challenges.

%7. Two phase. 

%9. Implementation / CVE . reduction

%10. Contribution
%     new model/ system / General -extension- .. new CVE..
