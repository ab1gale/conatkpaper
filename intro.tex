\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}


%1. Interleaving - crash - explicit behaviour - 
Conccurrent program is hard to be correct. 
Concurrency bugs are common in modern multi-thread programs. 
Some concurrent bugs cause order violation, wrong output, program crash. 

2. Recent study - con attacks - structural , consequence, [in-explicit severer]


3. Unfortunately, most extant work -- detect bug, corruption 
   Our study - old bug - attack
   However in danger
   Sigmod 

4. Two major challenges : 
a. concurrent bug detectors (justify) 

b. other input for attack


5. New model for general attacks [] -- *vulnerability window 


6. Leveraging this model, framework - address two challenges.

7. Two phase. 

9. Implementation / CVE . reduction

10. Contribution
     new model/ system / General -extension- .. new CVE..

11. The rest of section
