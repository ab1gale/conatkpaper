Conccurrent program hard to be correct. Concurrency bugs are common in modern muliti-thread programs. 
Some concurrent bugs lead to severe security consequences. This is called concurrent attacks.


Extant works well studied(study? ) detecting concurrent bugs. Most of them focus on detecting 
bug happenings. Our study shows that security consequences may happen after corrupted variable 
propageting through program execution. So current concurrent bug detection tools may 

Although some work (\conmem) propose to focus on severe bugs that may cause program crashes. 
However, our observations over \observenum concurrency attacks shows that ... 1. Hidden severe bugs may not causes program crash2. Crash bugs may make worse effects..
