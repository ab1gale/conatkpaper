\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}


%1. Interleaving - crash - explicit behaviour - 
Concurrency program is hard to be correct. 
Concurrency bugs are common in modern multi-threaded programs\cite{conmem:asplos10,conseq:asplos11}. 
These bugs cause order violation, wrong output, memory corruption.
Extant work focus on exploring interleaving that cause concurrency bugs, 
%and by employing memory sanitizers and thread sanitizers, severe concurrency bugs
%may be explicit(?..).

%2. Recent study - con attacks - structural , consequence, [in-explicit severer]
Recent studies\cite{acidrain:sigmod17,con:hotpar12} show rise of concern about \emph{concurrency attacks}.
By triggering concurrency bugs and employing subtle inputs, 
hackers may leverage the corrupted memory to construct 
attacks, including privilege escalations\cite{}, hijacking code execution\cite{}, bypassing security checks\cite{}, 
and breaking database integrity\cite{acidrain:sigmod17}.
However, these vulnerabilities often hide in large amount of concurrency bug reports. 
For example, bug information leveraged by a xxx attack is hidden in 1000 race reports 
produced by TSAN\cite{tsan}, a famous and widely used data race detector. 
Also, to construct concurrency attacks, despite the inputs of leveraged concurrency bugs, 
attacker may need other crafted inputs to exploit the vulnerabilities. 
In CVE-2017-7533 exploited by our team, 
despite leveraging a data race bug to construct kernel heap overflow, 
we also require another thread to be the victim target, 
and finally achieve arbitrary code execution and get a root shell.

Unfortunately, extant work\cite{tsan,conseq:asplos11} focuses on detecting concurrency bugs. 
Although some \cite{conmem:asplos10} propose to care about severity of consequences like program crash.
However, our study shows that 

%4. Two major challenges : 
%a. concurrent bug detectors (justify) 
%b. other input for attack


%5. New model for general attacks [] -- *vulnerability window 


%6. Leveraging this model, framework - address two challenges.

%7. Two phase.
