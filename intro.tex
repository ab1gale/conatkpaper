\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}


%1. Interleaving - crash - explicit behaviour - 
Concurrency program is hard to be correct. 
Concurrency bugs are common in modern multi-threaded programs\cite{conmem:asplos10,conseq:asplos11}. 
These bugs cause order violation, wrong output, memory corruption.
Extant work focus on exploring interleaving that cause concurrency bugs, 
and by employing memory sanitizers and thread sanitizers, severe concurrency bugs
may be explicit.



%2. Recent study - con attacks - structural , consequence, [in-explicit severer]
Recent studies\cite{acidrain:sigmod17,con:hotpar12} shows rise of concern about concurrency attacks.


3. Unfortunately, most extant work -- detect bug, corruption 
   Our study - old bug - attack
   However in danger
   Sigmod 

4. Two major challenges : 
a. concurrent bug detectors (justify) 

b. other input for attack


5. New model for general attacks [] -- *vulnerability window 


6. Leveraging this model, framework - address two challenges.

7. Two phase. 

9. Implementation / CVE . reduction

10. Contribution
     new model/ system / General -extension- .. new CVE..

11. The rest of section
