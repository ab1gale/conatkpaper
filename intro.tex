\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}


%1. Interleaving - crash - explicit behaviour - 
Multi-threaded program is hard to be correct. 
Concurrency bugs are common in modern multi-threaded programs\cite{lu:concurrency-bugs,conmem:asplos10,conseq:asplos11, lu:muvi:sosp} 
including atomic violation, ..., and especially data race.
Extant work well explore interleaving that cause concurrency bugs, 
and efficiently detect explicit concurrency bugs that direct to  
severe consequences such as execution order violation, wrong output and program crash.
%and by employing memory sanitizers and thread sanitizers, severe concurrency bugs
%may be explicit(?..).

%2. Recent study - con attacks - structural , consequence, [in-explicit severer]
Recent studies\cite{acidrain:sigmod17,con:hotpar12} show rise of concern about \emph{concurrency attacks}.
Just like sequential bugs leads to attacks, concurrency bugs also lead to concurrency attacks. 
By triggering concurrency bugs and employing subtle inputs, 
hackers may leverage the corrupted memory to conduct  
attacks including privilege escalations\cite{}, hijacking code execution\cite{}, bypassing security checks\cite{}, 
and breaking database integrity\cite{acidrain:sigmod17}.
These vulnerabilities often hide in large amount of concurrency bug reports. 
For example, bug information leveraged by a xxx attack is hidden in 1000 race reports 
produced by TSAN\cite{tsan}, a famous and widely used data race detector. 
%Also, to construct concurrency attacks, despite the inputs of leveraged concurrency bugs, 
%attacker may need other crafted inputs to exploit the vulnerabilities. 
Also, despite threads conducting concurrency bugs, 
behaviors of another thread may also be affected when data race bugs infecting shared memory (\eg heap overflow)\cite{apache-bug-25520,}. 


%3. Unfortunately, most extant work -- detect bug, corruption 
%   Our study - old bug - attack
%   However in danger
%   Sigmod 
Unfortunately, although great progress has been made to detect and replay severe bugs(\eg ConMem\cite{conmem:asplos10}), 
extant work still lacks exploration of concurrency attacks from enormous concurrency bugs. Our study over several known concurrency 
bugs\cite{apache-bug-25520, apache-bug-46215} shows that even concurrency bugs have been successfully detected and reported, 
professionals may still lack knowledge about how severe consequences these bugs may cause. 
For instance, \emph{apache-25520}\cite{apache-bug-25520} has been 
reported over years and well studied by researchers\cite{lu:concurrency-bugs}.  
We are the first to exploit a new heap overflow attack leveraging on this bug and break the HTML integrity.  

%4. Two major challenges : 
%a. concurrent bug detectors (justify) 
%b. other input for attack
We studied \nattacks attacks and find two major challenges for exploring concurrency attacks from concurrency bugs. 
First, concurrency attacks may be implicit and hidden in common concurrency bugs. 
Existing concurrent bug detectors focus on bug happening itself. 
ConMem\cite{conmem:asplos10} first propose to 
consider concurrency bugs that may cause severe consequences (\eg program crash)
and ConSeq\cite{conseq:asplos11} uses severe consequence report to help diagnose concurrency bugs. 
However, our observation shows that explicit error (\eg program crash) is not necessary for concurrency 
attacks. Some concurrency bugs (\eg \emph{xxx-xxx}) may not cause program crash or interrupted, 
but attackers may still leverage them and conduct attacks with crafted input. 
%Here the propagation path?
%
Worse still, crash bugs may even lead to more severe vulnerabilities. 
In \emph{CVE-2017-7533} conducted by our team, although the data race primarily causes kernel crash, 
we crafted the input and successfully conduct a privilege escalation attack without crashing the kernel.
Current concurrency bug detecting tools are not designed to analyze this kind of latent vulnerabilities, 
and hence may direct wrong level of warnings towards the bugs.  


Second, extant work ignores indicating the \emph{victim thread} of concurrency attacks.
A concurrency bug may become much more vulnerable when attackers employee another thread to construct 
their attacks. 
In CVE-2017-7533, we do not only leverage two threads to trigger a data race and construct kernel heap overflow, 
but also require another \emph{victim thread} to lay the target structure on the same heap. 
By crafting inputs and corrupt the target structure, we finally achieve arbitrary code execution and get a root shell. 
Automatically indicating the victim thread would be of vital helpful for developers to better understand the latent vulnerabilities.
For example, in the Apache-25520 case, after knowing about information of victim thread, 
we successfully increased the severity of the bug and conducted an integrity violation.

%5. New model for general attacks [] -- *vulnerability window 

To address the two challenges, we introduced a new model that explains most concurrency attacks we studied. 
The model breaks down concurrency attacks into three stages: bug happening, bug-to-attack propagation, 
and attack happening. Bug happening is where the concurrency bugs happened. 


%6. Leveraging this model, framework - address two challenges.
Leveraging this model, we designed a two-phase framework, \xxx, for detecting concurrency attacks. 
%7. Two phase. 
The first phase is \emph{concurrency analyzer} to . 

The second phase is \emph{concurrency fuzzer?} to ... .

%9. Implementation / CVE . reduction
We implemented \xxx on Linux, supporting both user space and kernel space attack detection. 



We evaluated OWL on 6 diverse, widely used programs, including Apache, Chrome, Libsafe, Linux kernel, MySQL,
and SSDB. OWL’s benign schedule hints and runtime verifiers reduced 94.3\% of the race reports, 
and it did not miss the evaluated concurrency attacks. With the greatly reduced reports,
OWL’s vulnerable input hints helped us identify subtle
vulnerable inputs, leading to the detection of 7 known concurrency
attacks as well as 3 previous unknown, severe ones
in SSDB and Apache. The analysis performance of OWL was
reasonable for in-house testing.

This paper makes two major contributions:

\begin{tightenum}
\item \textbf{A general model explains happening and exploiting of concurrency attacks.} 
This model explains most concurrency attacks in wild and 
providing two major direction for detecting concurrency attacks. 
	
\item \textbf{A general concurrency attack detection framework and its implementation, \xxx.} 
\xxx can easily employ existing concurrent bug detectors and vulnerability analyzer 
to improve the accuracy and ??? of detection.
