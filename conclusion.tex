\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

% Software bugs in both sequential programs and concurrent programs can lead to 
% security attacks.

We have presented the first quantitative study on real-world concurrency 
attacks and \xxx, the first analysis framework to effectively detect them. \xxx 
accurately detect a number of known and previously unknown concurrency attacks 
on large, widely used programs. We believe that our study will attract much 
more attention to further detect and defend against concurrency attacks. Our 
\xxx framework has the potential to bridge the gap between concurrency bugs and 
their attacks. All our study results, exploit scripts, and \xxx source code 
with raw evaluation results are available at \github.
